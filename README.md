>The proof-of-stake mechanism was originally proposed and applied by PeerCoin (block generation probability = token quantity * coin age). Simply put, whoever has more coins has a greater probability of block generation. But digging deeper, who will calculate the probability of block generation? What should I do if I encounter the problem of no-cost benefit relationship? This consensus algorithm is very simple at first glance, but there are actually many problems to be solved. Letâ€™s see when Ethereum can completely switch to the POS mechanism

block structure
```go
type block struct {
	// hash of the previous block
	prehash string
	//this block hash
	hash string
	//time stamp
	timestamp string
	// block content
	data string
	// block height

	height int
	//Dig out the address of this block
	address string
}
```
Declare two node pools\
mineNodesPool Used to store specified mining nodes\
probabilityNodesPool  The number of tokens used to deposit into the mining node * the probability of obtaining the currency age
```go
// used to store the blockchain
var blockchain []block
//represent mining node
type node struct{
	// number of tokens
	tokens int
	// pledge time
	days  int
	//node address
	address string
}
//mining node
var mineNodesPool []node
//probability node pool

var  probabilityNodesPool []node
```
Initialize the node pool:
```go
func init () {
	// Manually add two nodes
	mineNodesPool = append(mineNodesPool,node{1000,1,"AAAAAAAAAA"})
	mineNodesPool = append(mineNodesPool,node{100,3,"BBBBBBBBBB"})
	//Initialize the random node pool (the mining probability is related to the number of tokens and the age of tokens)
	for _,v:=range mineNodesPool{
		for i:=0;i<=v.tokens * v.days; i ++ {
			randNodesPool = append(randNodesPool,v)
		}
	}
}
```
Each mining will randomly select the address of the node that obtains the block right from the probability node pool
```go
// Randomly get the mining address (the mining probability is related to the number of tokens and the age of the token)
func getMineNodeAddress() string{
	bInt:=big.NewInt(int64(len(randNodesPool)))
	/ / Get a random number, the maximum does not exceed the size of the random node pool
	rInt,err:=rand.Int(rand.Reader,bInt)
	if err != nil {
		log.Panic(err)
	}
	return randNodesPool[int(rInt.Int64())].address
}
```


```go
func main() {
	//create genesis block
	genesisBlock := block{"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","",time.Now().Format("2006-01-02 15:04:05"),"I am the genesis block",1,"0000000000"}
	genesisBlock.getHash()
	//Add the genesis block to the blockchain
	blockchain = append(blockchain,genesisBlock)
	fmt.Println(blockchain[0])
	i:=0
	for  {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		newBlock:=generateNewBlock(blockchain[i],"I am block content","00000")
		blockchain = append(blockchain,newBlock)
		fmt.Println(blockchain[i + 1])
		i++
	}
}
```
